# Intro to AWS Networking

## Overview
Kickoff project for AWS Networking Series, focusing on understanding cloud networking fundamentals and VPC basics.

## Services Used
- Amazon VPC (theoretical intro)

## Key Concepts Learned
- Cloud networks replicate traditional networking but are virtualised.  
- Networks move packets between devices, enabling communication and services.  
- A VPC is a private segment of AWS where traffic flow, access, and security are controlled.

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: Conceptual learning, no major obstacles.  
- Solution: Committed 50 hours/week study log to build strong networking foundation.

## Time Taken
Part of ongoing series (intro stage)

## Why This Project Matters
Lays the foundation for all later VPC/EC2/security networking projects.
