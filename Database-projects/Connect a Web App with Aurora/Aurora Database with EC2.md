# Aurora Database with EC2

## Overview
Created an Aurora cluster and connected it with an EC2 instance, testing relational database basics with SQL.

## Services Used
- Amazon Aurora  
- Amazon EC2  

## Key Concepts Learned
- Relational DBs = tables, rows, columns linked via SQL.  
- Aurora automatically handles backups + failover.  
- Clusters include writer + reader instances.  

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: Aurora required EC2 setup before connecting.  
- Solution: Launched EC2 with key pair + DNS, then connected.  

## Time Taken
~45 minutes  

## Why This Project Matters
Shows how to combine EC2 and Aurora into a basic but reliable database-driven setup.
