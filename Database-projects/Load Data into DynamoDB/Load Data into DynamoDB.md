# Load Data into DynamoDB

## Overview
Created DynamoDB tables via AWS CLI/CloudShell, loaded JSON data with batch-write-item, and explored schemaless flexibility.

## Services Used
- Amazon DynamoDB  
- AWS CLI / CloudShell  

## Key Concepts Learned
- NoSQL = schemaless, flexible attributes per item.  
- Partition key ensures unique item IDs.  
- RCUs/WCUs define performance + cost.  
- Free Tier = 25 GB + 25 RCUs/25 WCUs.  

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: File naming/hidden extensions caused issues.  
- Solution: Fixed file formats and reran CLI commands.  

## Time Taken
~1 hour  

## Why This Project Matters
Hands-on with NoSQL basics, setting the stage for scalable app backends.
