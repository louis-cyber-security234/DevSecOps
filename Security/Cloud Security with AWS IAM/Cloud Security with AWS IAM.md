# Cloud Security with AWS IAM

## Overview
Practiced IAM security by tagging EC2 instances and enforcing least-privilege access. Created IAM users, groups, and JSON policies to restrict interns to development resources only.

## Services Used
- AWS IAM  
- Amazon EC2  

## Key Concepts Learned
- IAM policies (Effect, Action, Resource).  
- Tag-based access control (Env=development).  
- IAM users vs user groups.  
- Account alias simplifies login.  
- IAM Policy Simulator for testing.  

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: Understanding tag-based conditions in IAM policies.  
- Solution: Used tags + simulator to validate access correctly.  

## Time Taken
~1 hour  

## Why This Project Matters
IAM is the backbone of AWS securityâ€”tag-based policies enforce granular access for multi-environment deployments.
